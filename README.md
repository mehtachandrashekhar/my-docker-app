# My Docker App

This project is a simple Docker-based application designed to demonstrate containerization and deployment using Docker. The application can be easily deployed using Docker containers and has all the necessary configurations to get started quickly.

## Features

- **Containerization:** The app is fully containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Easy Setup:** With a simple set of commands, you can have the app running locally or in production.
- **Scalable:** This setup can be easily scaled as needed.

## Prerequisites

To run this app, you need the following tools installed on your machine:

- **Docker** (version 19.03 or higher)
- **Docker Compose** (optional, for multi-container applications)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the application up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehtachandrashekhar/my-docker-app.git
cd my-docker-app
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Use the following command to build the Docker image from the Dockerfile provided in the repository:

```bash
docker build -t my-docker-app .
```

### 3. Run the Container

Once the Docker image is built, you can run the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-docker-app
```

This will start the application and map it to port 5000 on your local machine. You can now access the app by navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Using Docker Compose (Optional)

If you want to use Docker Compose to run the application, ensure you have `docker-compose.yml` configured (provided in the repository). Then, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start the app with all required services.

## Customization

You can modify the application as needed and rebuild the Docker image using the steps above. The app can be adapted to include additional services, configurations, or external dependencies by editing the `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` file.
